<p>I’m a self-taught web developer living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, Greece. I specialize in building web applications for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p>I came to programming from a non-traditional background. I had worked in sales, manufacturing, the restaurant business, and even had a few odd jobs before I decided to make the leap into web development.</p>
<p>This decision didn’t come out of the blue.</p>
<p>Not feeling fulfilled at work, takes its toll. On an emotional level, at some point, I felt like I hit a wall.
Programming seemed to be the right candidate to transition from an unfulfilling job to something meaningful. It fits my personality, and strengths.
More particularly, I love the concept of lifelong learning, to solve puzzles, and being a team player.</p>
<p>The world of the internet appealed to me even in my previous job.
From installing web analytics, to uploading content to a WordPress site, and making file changes via a cPanel I was always willing to learn and implement something new. 
It didn’t take long before I started to write simple HTML and CSS code for marketing related landing pages. 
From there the decision to pursue programming came naturally.
I didn’t know for sure where this journey would lead me but I was willing to take it anyway.</p>
<p>This journey is still in progress and there is a long way to go.
The idea that I have to push myself being comfortable getting out of my comfort zone makes me feel alive. 
And my goal is to stay as long as I can in this competitive world where tomorrow is never the same as today.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-blog">Why I blog</h2>
<p>There is nothing here that has not been said before, Nor do I have any skill in composition. Thus, I have no concern for others and I have composed my text solely to cultivate my own mind. Since my virtue is cultivated, My faith thereby increases in power. Nonetheless, if someone else with an outlook like my own Sees this, it would be meaningful.</p>
<p>Thus, my purpose is to solidify my own knowledge of this practice. My hope is that the medium of a blog will allow others to benefit from my Writing to Learn endeavor.</p>
<p>Writing organizes and clarifies our thoughts. Writing is how we think our way into a subject and make it our own. Writing enables us to find out what we know-and what we don&rsquo;t know-about whatever we&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>

<h2 id="life-beyond-programming">Life beyond programming</h2>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not in front of a computer, coding or/and reading about programming I usually spent time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gardening:</strong> My wife and I live in an independent house in a small town 20 minutes drive from downtown Thessaloniki. A backyard with lawn and olive trees and a front yard rose garden surrounds our home. This beautiful garden requires regular maintenance. Thanks to gardening I take regular screen breaks. It&rsquo;s a great excuse to unplug myself from my computer :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Walking:</strong> I walk my dog Rocky every day. It&rsquo;s the time of the day that relaxes me the most and it&rsquo;s also a good way to connect with my hairy body. In weekends I usually go for a stroll with my wife in downtown Thessaloniki or in our neighbor. Walking is what I do when I want to think clearly, make a decision or just relax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> I spend a lot of time reading. Reading has always been my favorite pastime.
From classic  novels and crime fiction to history, whitepapers, and technical guides, reading books is the best way to travel in time, visit distant places, and above all, pick the brain of successful people.
For me is also the best way to learn programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Going on Excursions:</strong> blah blah</p>
</li>
</ul>
